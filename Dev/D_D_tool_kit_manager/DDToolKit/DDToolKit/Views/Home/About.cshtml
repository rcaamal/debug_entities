        For those who are interested in D&D and whom want to have a more accessible and
        streamlined experience, the Debug Entities website is both a tool kit and
        game running aid that will provide bookkeeping assistance as well as
        multiple visuals for facilitating interactions of the user and the
        often-complex aspects of the game. It will also contain visuals for
        the characters and items. Unlike other D&D simulators and games, our D&D: tool kit & Manager website
        will have a rich search functionality so users can search through the many
        books in the database and find data from only what they need instead of wasting
        time going through hundreds of pages of hard-covered books manually.
    </p>

    <p>
        Debug Entities Goals for the D&D Tool Kit & Manager is to be able to have
        a working website that will be useful for other users that play D&D. This
        will have its tools of ability to search for certain aspects of the database
        that we will implement in this website, like monsters, spells, and equipment. This way
        a user is capable of going through books full of monsters, spells, and equiment so they can look
        it up faster for their information instead of passing through tons of books
        to find what they want for their game. We want to change their experience of D&D than
        their previous moments in other D&D gaming. Due to our experience we want to make it
        better for other users as well, those who are new could learn how to play D&D through
        our tutorials and step by step process that we want to create for this website .
        Also, we want to be able to make this a more luring environment for our users
        and we want give them a better view of D&D to show that it is a fun and entertaining
        game.

        I am a dual major, in Computer Science and Interdisciplinary Studies.
        My focus areas in Interdisciplinary Studies is Social Science and Humanities.
        After college I want to be able to find a job that is in health care, or any other job that helps others
        that uses my computer science degree. With that intent I want be a clinical analyst or tech assistant or
        work in Human Resorces

        I am from Saudi Arabia. I am a bilingual speaker, and I speak Arabic and English.  
        I am a senior student at Western Oregon University and I am majoring in Computer Science.
        One of the things that i like about coding is that coding is about making things that are useful to other 
        people that makes their lives easier and faster when it comes to looking for specific information they desire. 
        For example, creating a gaming website or an educational website that can be beneficial to students.  
        In the future, I would like to have my own company. This company would provide schools and every district that is 
        related to education with the best technology tools to help students to have a better future.

        I am a senior in the computer science department at western Oregon university, although I didn’t originally start out my 
        college life here in the program. No, I began as an engineering student at Portland state university in their honor’s 
        program before reevaluating my passions and becoming a computer science major. Shortly after the switch, I moved back
        here to Monmouth in order to take advantage of the program here.
        Here is some work I have done. <a href="https://github.com/Ioberst17">Git Hub</a>  </pre>

    <p>
        Debug entities wants to achieve a better experience a for our users, an ability for
        them to see that not all D&D are the same and want to make this D&D website better
        for the users to experience D&D like they never have before and to enjoy playing
        it more than before and also for those who are new could enjoy their first time
        playing to see that it is better than most people have talked about. Give them
        an opportunity to see what other D&D players see about the gaming experience and to
        give them a chance to enjoy it.
